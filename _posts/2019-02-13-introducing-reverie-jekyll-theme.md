Hello World, this is Renzo speaking or should I say blogging. This is my first blog post which will give you an introduction on why I created this blog and what this blog is going to be about. Let's get started.

I started dabbling in Artificial Intelligence in the middle of 2018. My thesis project in college was going to involve Artificial Intelligence so I started studying about it early on. I started with Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera but could not finish it because my groupmates and I decided that we were going to incorporate deep learning as the heart of our thesis project. Thus, I shifted to the Deep Learning Specialization by, none other than, Andre Ng, again. I started with the first course Neural Networks and Deep Learning. One statement of his really stuck on to me and got me hooked into AI, {% include pullquote.html quote="&quot;AI is the new electricity.&quot;" %}

For Andrew, Artificial Intelligence was about to bring about a wave of change in our way of life to the point that AI would be ubiquitous to our daily lives and that thinking really stuck to me. Come to think of it, AI is part of our daily lives more than we give it credit for. It found in the virtual assistants that you may or may not use. It is found on the shopping sites where you buy things that you don't even need but feel obligated to. It is found on your favorite music and video streaming services. It is found on your phone's camera.

The first lessons of the first course were simple enough because they were only general concepts. As the course progressed, a lot of Math was introduced which proved challenging even though I was an engineering student. Good thing Andrew, was a master of calming people down with one of his famous quoutes, "Don't worry about it if you don't understand." Finishing course 1, I stopped doing the specialization to focus on my thesis where I used a lot of the concepts of course 1 in doing the project.

Finishing my thesis and eventually graduating, I resumed the deep learning specialization and started making jupyter notebooks detailing each lesson and even going "deeper", no pun intended, on some other topics in hopes to have something to go back to in case I forget some concepts. By doing this, I began to appreciate AI even more and highlighted some use cases I had in mind. I had many "hey I can use this concept for X and Y" moments where Andrew would explain something and I would think of a use case for myself where I could apply it. I remembered how Andrew viewed AI as the new electricity and thought of some use-cases so I could make AI truly ubiquitous in my life. Thus, I came up with this blog where I can share with you how I use Artificial Intelligence to address some of my needs in life no matter how quirky. In this blog, I hope to create tutorials, highlighting the premise of the use case and how I used AI to fill that use case, and, hopefully, talk about anything of interest for me in this blog.

The title AI4U is literally the vision I have for Artificial Intelligence. I beleive AI should assist humanity and make people's lives easier.

## Using Reverie on GitHub Pages

### Step 1) Fork Reverie to your User Repository

Fork [this repository](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), then rename the repository to `yourgithubusername.github.io`.

Alternatively, you can use [Use this template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie/generate) button if you want to create a repository with a clean commit history which will use Reverie as a template.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the `_config.yml` file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here.

Making a change to `_config.yml` (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Create a new file called `/_posts/2019-2-13-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. That's all you need to do to publish your first blog post! This [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) might come in handy while writing the posts.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the <kbd>Create new file</kbd> button in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Using Categories in Reverie

You can categorize your content based on `categories` in Reverie. For this, you just need to add `categories` in front matter like below:

For adding single category:

```md
categories: JavaScript
```

For adding multiple categories:

```md
categories: [PHP, Laravel]
```

The contegorized content can be shown over this URL: <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/categories/>

## RSS

The generated [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/feed>. You can see the example RSS feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/feed).

## Sitemap

The generated sitemap of your blog can be found at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io/sitemap>. You can see the example sitemap feed over [here](https://www.amitmerchant.com/reverie/sitemap).
