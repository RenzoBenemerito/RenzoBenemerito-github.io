Hello World, this is Renzo speaking or should I say blogging. This is my first blog post which will give you an introduction detailing how I got into Artificial Intelligence (AI), my motivation in creating this blog and what kind of posts you can expect from me. Let's get started.

I started dabbling in Artificial Intelligence in the middle of 2018. My thesis project back in college was going to involve Artificial Intelligence so I started searching about it early on. I enrolled in the course, Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera. When we were still kids, we thought of Artificial Intelligence as robots or programs, able to mimick human capabilities. I used to be amazed and afraid of skynet and terminator as a kid. However, when I started the course, I realized it was more of the application of Mathematics for finding correlations in data to find a functional mapping from input to output. Of course, that definition is still just a gist of AI but, honestly, we are still very far away from the skynet-like AI we were watching as kids.  Going back on topic, me and my thesis mates decided on using deep learning for our project which involved image classification so, I shifted to another course of Andrew Ng, the Deep Learning Specialization.

I started with the first course Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The first lessons were simple enough, consisting of mostly, general concepts but one statement of Andrew really stuck on to me and got me hooked into AI, {% include pullquote.html quote="&quot;AI is the new electricity.&quot;" %}

For Andrew, Artificial Intelligence was about to bring about a wave of change in our way of life to the point that AI would be ubiquitous to our daily lives and that thinking really stuck on to me. Come to think of it, AI is part of our daily lives more than we give it credit for. It is found in the virtual assistants on our phones and speakers. It is found on the shopping sites where you buy things that you don't even need but feel obligated to because of a limited time offer sale. It is found on your favorite music and video streaming services to give song or show recommendations. It is even found on your phone's camera.

As the course progressed, as with the Machine Learning course, a lot of Math was introduced which proved challenging even though I was an engineering student. Good thing Andrew, was a master of calming people down with one of his famous quoutes, "Don't worry about it if you don't understand." Kidding aside, it is equally important to understand the Math behind these algorithms so do find time to understand them. Finishing course 1, I stopped doing the specialization to focus on my thesis where I used a lot of the concepts I learned in doing the project.

Finishing my thesis and eventually graduating, I resumed the deep learning specialization and started making jupyter notebooks detailing each lesson and even going "deeper", no pun intended, on some other topics in hopes to have something to go back to in case I forget some concepts. By doing this, I began to appreciate AI even more and even highlighted some use-cases I had in mind. I had many "hey I can use this concept for X and Y" moments where Andrew would explain something and I would think of a use case for myself where I could apply it. I remembered how Andrew viewed AI as the new electricity and thought of some use-cases so I could truly make AI truly ubiquitous in my life.

Thus, I came up with this blog where I can share with you how I use Artificial Intelligence to address some of my needs in life no matter how quirky. The blog title title, AI4U (Artificial Inteligence for You), is literally the vision I have for Artificial Intelligence. I beleive AI should assist humanity and make people's lives easier. {% include pullquote.html quote="AI should be human-centric." %} It should be built not to replace humans but to coexist with humans to make life easier.

In this blog, I hope to create tutorials, highlighting the premise of a use-case I have thought of and how I used AI to fill that use case. I'll be writing about how I structure my Machine Learning or Deep Learning projects and, occasionally, you'll see posts about Data Science since I am a Data Scientist by profession. That's it for now, thanks for reading!
